# customer_behaviour_analysis
This project demonstrates a complete data analytics workflow — from raw data to insights.
It includes data loading, cleaning, exploration (EDA), SQL querying, visualization in Power BI, and creating a final business report and presentation using Gamma App.

The goal is to extract meaningful insights from the dataset and present them in a clear, data-driven format that supports decision-making.

📂 Dataset

Source: Public/open dataset (replace with actual source if available)

Format: CSV file

Size: (mention rows × columns if known)

Description: The dataset contains multiple features related to (briefly describe — e.g., customer behavior, transactions, sales, etc.).

🪜 Project Steps
1. Data Loading

Imported the dataset into Python using Pandas.

Checked the structure, data types, and missing values.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Used descriptive statistics and visualizations to understand data patterns.

Plotted distributions, correlations, and outliers using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

3. Data Cleaning

Handled missing values and outliers.

Removed duplicates and standardized column names.

Encoded categorical variables (if required).

4. SQL Analysis

Loaded the cleaned dataset into MySQL / SQL Server.

Ran analytical queries such as aggregations, joins, and filters to derive insights.

Validated key findings from EDA.

5. Power BI Dashboard

Imported the processed dataset into Power BI.

Created interactive dashboards with key KPIs, charts, and filters.

Focused on trends, performance, and actionable insights.

6. Reporting & Presentation

Summarized the entire analysis into a Gamma App report.

Designed a professional PowerPoint-style presentation highlighting objectives, methods, findings, and recommendations.
